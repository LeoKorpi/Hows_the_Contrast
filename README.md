# How's the contrast?

The website was a project for the course 'Web Development I' at Stockholm University. It was built using only HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS. No Frameworks.

The idea was to create a website that lets the user check that the contrast-ratio between two colors fulfills the WCAG requirement 1.4.3 & 1.4.6 (Color Contrast). The site can also be used to find accessible color combinations, tweak them and see them used in action. 

The colors of the foreground and background of the webpage are controlled by the user, which can either input hex-values or adjust the HSL-sliders to play around with the colors. The contrast ratio is obtained by sending the values of the foreground and background to WebAIM's Contrast Checker (https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) and fetching the results.

This website was what got me intrigued in Web Accessibility and it was fun learning more as development went on. The code feels a bit messy (but it works!), it would be fun to try and recreate the project using a modern framework and see how things would turn out.
